gtk/qt theme reading?

----INFO----

* Mime-Type
   Need to read the mimetypes and then browse the desktop files and find 'MimeType' keys that match

* Menu
   program will need a menu file to generate a menu struct.
   the command line interface will need output to multiple formats, potentially a subcommand, subcommand, AFAIK that is possible

* File Manager D-Bus interface
  This will be applicable if I want to make an open API for DBus file management handling

* recently-used/places might be a nice thing to offer an interface teasily access
